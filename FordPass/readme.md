## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `apps/FordPassConnect.groovy` | Hubitat app — OAuth PKCE flow, token management, API polling, child device creation |
| `drivers/FordPassVehicle.groovy` | Child device driver — parses vehicle data, exposes capabilities and attributes, relays commands |

---

## Installation

### Hubitat Package Manager (recommended)

[Hubitat Package Manager (HPM)](https://github.com/HubitatCommunity/hubitatpackagemanager) handles installation and future updates automatically.

1. If you don't have HPM installed yet, see the [HPM repo](https://github.com/HubitatCommunity/hubitatpackagemanager) for setup instructions.
2. Open HPM on your hub and choose **Install**.
3. Search for **FordPass Connect**.
4. Follow the prompts to install.

### Manual Installation

Import each file individually via your hub's code editor (**Apps Code** / **Drivers Code** → **New** → **Import** → paste the raw GitHub URL → **Import** → **Save**):

| Type | File | Import URL |
|---|---|---|
| Driver | FordPassVehicle | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacmanj/hubitat/main/FordPass/drivers/FordPassVehicle.groovy` |
| App | FordPassConnect | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacmanj/hubitat/main/FordPass/apps/FordPassConnect.groovy` |

Then: **Apps** → **Add User App** → **FordPass Connect**.

---

## Setup

The app walks you through four pages:

1. **Main** — status overview; shows token state and last poll time
2. **Region** — select brand (Ford or Lincoln) and region (USA, Canada, EU, AU, …)
3. **Auth** — generates a PKCE code challenge, gives you a Ford login URL to open in a browser, and accepts the redirect URL you paste back in
4. **VIN** — lists vehicles on the account; select one to create the child device

After setup the app polls the Ford/Autonomic APIs on a configurable interval and pushes data to the child device.

---

## ABRP Live Data (Optional)

The app can push live telemetry to [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) (ABRP)
on every poll, so ABRP's route/energy predictions use your vehicle's real-time SOC, position, speed,
and charging state instead of stale data.

Setup:

1. In the ABRP app or abetterrouteplanner.com, open your vehicle → **Live Data** → link it using the
   **Generic** connection method. ABRP gives you a token.
2. In the FordPass Connect app's main page, enable **Push live telemetry to ABRP** and paste that
   token into **ABRP Generic Token**.

Telemetry (SOC, lat/lon, speed, external temperature, charging state) is sent to ABRP's telemetry
endpoint (`api.iternio.com/1/tlm/send`) right after each scheduled poll — so the ABRP push interval
matches your **Polling Interval** setting. No separate schedule or child device is created for this.

## Driver Preferences

| Preference | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Tire pressure unit | PSI | PSI / kPa / BAR |
| Distance unit | miles | miles / km |
| Home geofence radius | 200 m | Radius around hub location for presence detection |
| Enable debug logging | off | Auto-disables after 2 hours |

### Geofence presence

Set the hub's location under **Settings → Location** in Hubitat. The driver computes the Haversine distance between the vehicle's GPS position and the hub's coordinates; if within the configured radius it reports `present`, otherwise `not present`.

---

## Debugging

1. Enable **"Enable debug logging"** in driver preferences — logs auto-disable after 2 hours.
2. Open **Hubitat Logs** filtered to the device name.
3. Unmatched door, window, or tire API values are logged at debug level with the raw `vehicleDoor` / `vehicleWindow` / `vehicleWheel` field values — useful for diagnosing vehicles with non-standard field names (e.g. Mach-E uses `UNSPECIFIED_FRONT` instead of `FRONT_LEFT`).

> **Ford's API is undocumented and changes without warning.** All JSON parsing is defensive — unexpected fields are logged at debug level rather than causing errors.

---

## Token Lifecycle

- **Ford Foundational token** — refreshed automatically before each API call; a background job also runs every 4 minutes as a safety net.
- **Autonomic token** — exchanged using the Ford token; refreshed on the same schedule.
- Token state is stored in the app's `state` map and survives hub reboots.

---

## Known Limitations

- No automated tests — all verification requires a real connected vehicle with live Ford API credentials.
- Guard mode uses a separate Ford MPS endpoint; availability is vehicle-dependent.
- Preconditioning uses the Ford RCC API; only available on Mach-E and RCC-capable vehicles.
- `requestStatusRefresh()` asks the vehicle to push an update — the vehicle must have cellular connectivity and may take up to 5 minutes to respond.

## Credits

Ported from [marq24/ha-fordpass](https://github.com/marq24/ha-fordpass). All API behavior, data structures, and auth flow are derived from that Home Assistant integration.

Originally developed in the `hubitat/` directory of [dacmanj/ha-fordpass](https://github.com/dacmanj/ha-fordpass) (a fork of marq24/ha-fordpass), which cross-references the Home Assistant integration's Python source when diagnosing Ford API changes. Moved here to live alongside this author's other published Hubitat packages; the fork remains useful as a reference when the Ford API changes.
